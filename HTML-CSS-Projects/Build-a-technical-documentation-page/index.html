                    Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It
                    has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the
                    reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and
                    digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are
                    still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java
                    installed. <a href="https://www.java.com/" target="_blank">Java.com</a> is intended for consumers
                    who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java
                    8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the <a
                        href="https://dev.java/" target="_blank">dev.java</a> website instead and business users should
                    visit <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/" target="_blank">oracle.com/java</a> for more
                    information.

                <p>Why Use Java?</p>
                <ul class="benefits">
                    <li>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)</li>
                    <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
                    <li>It is easy to learn and simple to use</li>
                    <li>It is open-source and free</li>
                    <li>It is secure, fast and powerful</li>
                    <li>It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)</li>
                    <li>Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to
                        be reused, lowering development costs</li>
                    <li>As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.

                <p>After writing some Java code in a text editor, the code has to be transformed to another format,

                <p>Java is an object-oriented language. So to begin writing cocde, your code must be held in a Java
                    class</p>
                <div class="codeIDE">
                    <pre class="line-number">
              <code>
public class HelloWorld {
  //Your code goes here
}
              </code>
            </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The name of this Java class is HelloWorld. You need to save this text in a file named
                    HelloWorld.java. A Java class must be saved in a file that has the same name as your class with the
                    extension .java. This is mandatory and is in fact very convenient because you do not need to open a
                    file to know what class is written in it.
                </p>
                <p>You can give this class any name as long as it does not start with a number. There is a convention
                    though: the name of a Java class starts with a capital letter. This is not mandatory but all Java
                    developers follow this convention. When you become a seasoned Java developer, seeing a class that
                    does not follow this convention will look weird to you.
                </p>
                <p>The set of code that you will on the website is a code for printing <em>Hello, World!</em>. You also
                    may see a long technical string but do not worry about that for now. If you want, within the
                    quotations (""), you can change the text content to anything that is text, for example your name.
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_Variables">
            <header>Java Variables</header>
            <article>
                The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:
                <ul class="varibles-list">
                    <li><strong>Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)</strong> Technically speaking, objects store
                        their individual states in "non-static fields", that is, fields declared without the static
                        keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because their values are unique
                        to each instance of a class (to each object, in other words); the currentSpeed of one bicycle is
                        independent from the currentSpeed of another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Class Variables (Static Fields)</strong> A class variable is any field declared with the
                        static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in
                        existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated. A field defining the
                        number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle could be marked as static since conceptually
                        the same number of gears will apply to all instances. The code static int numGears = 6; would
                        create such a static field. Additionally, the keyword final could be added to indicate that the
                        number of gears will never change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Variables</strong> Similar to how an object stores its state in fields, a method
                        will often store its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local
                        variable is similar to declaring a field (for example, int count = 0;). There is no special
                        keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the location in
                        which the variable is declared — which is between the opening and closing braces of a method. As
                        such, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not
                        accessible from the rest of the class.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parameters</strong> You've already seen examples of parameters, both in the Bicycle
                        class and in the main method of the "Hello World!" application. Recall that the signature for
                        the main method is public static void main(String[] args). Here, the args variable is the
                        parameter to this method. The important thing to remember is that parameters are always
                        classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as
                        well (such as constructors and exception handlers) that you'll learn about later in the
                        tutorial.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Naming Variables</strong> When it comes to nameing a varibale, like many other coding
                    languages, there are rules and conventions for naming your varible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive. It is good practice to not begin your varible name with "$"
                        or the underscore character, "_".</li>
                    <li>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters.
                        Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your
                        variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations, and make sure that it is not a
                        keyword or reserved word. This is so that it would be easy to read when someone else or yourself
                        have to come back to what have been coded.</li>
                    <li>If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If
                        it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The
                        names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a
                        constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly,
                        capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By
                        convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
                Although there are many types of variables, for simplicity, we will focus on the more common and
                beginner friend data types.
                <ul class="data-list">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>String</strong> objects are immutable, which means that once created, their values
                            cannot be changed. The String class is not technically a primitive data type, but
                            considering the special support given to it by the language, you will probably tend to think
                            of it as such.</p>
                        <div class="codeIDE">

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>int</strong>: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1.
              <div class="codeIDE">
                <pre class="line-number">

              <strong>double</strong>: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.
              <div class="codeIDE">

                <pre class="line-number">

            <li>
              <strong>char</strong>: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of \u0000 (or 0) and a maximum value of \uffff (or 65,535 inclusive).
              <div class="codeIDE">

              </li>
            <li>
              <strong>float</strong>: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Use a float instead of double if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. This data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.

                <p>Java divides the operators into the following groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
                    <li>Assignment operators</li>
                    <li>Comparison operators</li>

                <h2 class="subhead">The If-Then Statement</h2>
                <p>The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to
                    execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true. For example, the
                    Bicycle class could allow the brakes to decrease the bicycle's speed only if the bicycle is already
                    in motion. One possible implementation of the applyBrakes() method could be as follows:</p>
                <div class="codeIDE">
                    <pre class="line-number">
              <code>
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

if (20 > 18) {
  System.out.println("20 is greater than 18");
}
                </code>
            </pre>
                </div>
                <p>If this test evaluates to false (meaning that the bicycle is not in motion), control jumps to the end
                    of the if-then statement.</p>
                <h2 class="subhead">The If-Then-Else Statement</h2>
                <p>The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to
                    false.</p>
